## Course Description
This seminar provides graduate students with the opportunity to conduct independent research, collaborate on innovative projects, and present findings in a professional academic format. The course emphasizes problem formulation, scholarly research, prototype development, and results dissemination. Students will develop technical communication skills and research maturity by presenting work and critiquing peers.  


## Choosing the Right Topic
The most important step in this seminar is **selecting a research topic that aligns with your long-term goals**. A well-chosen project can serve as a bridge to your next career stage:  

- **Industry & Job Applications** – A strong project can become a portfolio piece, showcased on GitHub, LinkedIn, or during technical interviews.  
- **PhD Preparation** – A carefully scoped research question can grow into a thesis proposal or form the basis of future publications.  
- **Entrepreneurship & Startups** – A seminar project can evolve into a prototype or minimum viable product (MVP), positioning you to pursue entrepreneurial opportunities.  

Students are encouraged to **strategically pick a topic that excites them** while also demonstrating depth, technical skills, and originality. The instructor will work closely with each student to refine the topic so it is both **ambitious and achievable** within the semester.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, students will:  
1. Formulate a research question or problem statement.  
2. Conduct a focused literature review and synthesize findings.  
3. Design and implement a small prototype or system.  
4. Present progress and final results in academic formats.  
5. Deliver professional-quality documentation (slides, report, GitHub repository).

## Deliverables
- **Google Slides** (for research presentation and final results)  
- **GitHub Repository** (containing code, documentation, and prototype)  
- **Final Report** (6–10 pages, conference-style format)

## Tentative Schedule (16 Weeks)

### **Phase 1: Foundations & Research (Weeks 1–6)**  
- **Week 1:** Course introduction, topic selection, expectations, team formation (if applicable).  
- **Week 2–5:** Independent research time (students explore topics, the state of the art on the topic, and the proposed work/solution).  

### **Phase 2: Presentations of Research Topics (Weeks 6–8)**  
- **Weeks 6–8:** Student presentations of research topics.  
  - Each student delivers a 15 minute seminar talk.  
  - Peer feedback and discussion follow each presentation.  

### **Phase 3: Prototype Building (Weeks 10–12)**  
- **Weeks 9–12:** Students build a prototype/system based on research.  
  - Weekly progress reports.  
  - Instructor/peer feedback sessions.  

### **Phase 4: Initial Results & Presentations (Weeks 13–15)**  
- **Weeks 13–15:** Students present initial results of their builds.  
  - Focus on live demo, methodology, early findings, and technical challenges.  
  - Peer feedback for improvements before final submission.  

### **Phase 5: Wrap-Up & Deliverables (Week 16)**  
- **Week 16:** Final presentations + submission of:  
  - Google Slides (final talk)  
  - GitHub Repo (with code & documentation)  
  - Final Report
